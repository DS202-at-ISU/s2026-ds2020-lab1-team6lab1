### step 12.2

- Ryan’s note: Creating our repository was straightforward and the
  instructions made it clear.

### step 12.3

- Ryan’s note: I had accidentally skipped the git configuration part
  when creating the R Studio project but it was an easy fix; I have
  experience with git commands in the terminal.

- Ishan’s note: I successfully cloned the project from the github repo
  on RStudio on my computer.

### step 12.4

- Ryan’s note: Instructions make it clear on how to commit using R
  Studio, but I think I would rather use git commands in the terminal
  since I’m already comfortable with that.

- Ishan’s note: I wrote this line in RStudio and saved the changes to
  the md file. I commit my changes.

### step 12.5

- Ryan’s note: Similar to step 12.4, instructions were clear and I had
  no problems using R Studio’s UI to make changes to the remote
  repository.

### step 12.6

- Ryan’s note: Able to see my changes from the previous steps and the
  message from R Studio in the readme.

# Lab report \#1

work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
